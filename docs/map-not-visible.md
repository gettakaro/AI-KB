# My map is not visible

Ensure you have the map enabled in your server config.

// todo: some xml snippet to enable the map ?

Afterwards, you can use the `visitmap full` command to display the map. Note that visitmap can take a while to generate the map, and it may take up significant CPU and memory resources, so it is recommended to run it during off-peak hours.
